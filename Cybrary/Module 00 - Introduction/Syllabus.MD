Now before we get into the actual material I have the syllabus which are which essentially gives you the 8 domains that we're going to cover that are part of the CISSP exam now all domains are not created equal not all questions are created equal ISC squared does wait the questions and you will certainly find that you have more exam questions from one topic rather than another now chapter one. Security and risk management I cannot stress to you enough how very tactic testable this chapter is because it deals with risks and it moves towards business continuity the reason that's so important is every decision we make starts with looking at the risks even if you're not even aware that you're doing that we always are looking to risks and we're never really done managing risks either risk management is a huge portion of IT security now everything that we do that starts with risk management marches towards the idea of business continuity so they aren't very important chapter the vast majority of your questions would come from this chapter when I say the vast majority there is no other topic on this exam in my experience in my opinion that's tested on the step all right chapter 2 asset security this is kind of a short chapter that deals with things like classifying data and protecting data based on its classification not a tremendously long chapter in a lot of the things that are here are gonna be covered in more depth in later chapters now chapter 3 security engineering good information in this chapter we start off with that for those of you that we're familiar with that tended main version of the CISSP exam this used to be referred to a security architecture and design so what we're gonna focus on in chapter 3 is we're going to focus on the idea that secure design you'll to secure product meaning that we don't think of security as an afterthought we build security into the mechanism this will be the chapter also that we look at the actual elements of computer architecture like the CPU and memory those ideas and we also look at security models on which we base our systems are on which we build our systems so depending whether or not we want confidentiality or integrity we looked at various models. That didn't produce before us another hugely important topic that is in this chapter is cryptography and that's one of the first things that I noticed is when I S. C. square put out the new domain which tend to banks down to 8 the first thing that jumped out at me is made worse cryptography because it's been such a huge part of the exams in the past it still is they just tucked it under security engineering because of course cryptography brings us the actual security that we need so security engineering civic chapter that's where crypto is script does very important topic next chapter communications and network security this used to be called telecommunications and it really does focus on the essentials of networking understanding the OSI reference model getting what the protocols are attacks at certain layers of the OSI model mitigating strategies a lot of good information there very testable to Maine as well I didn't see and access management so looking at all the ways we control access to the main starting with the identity and identification of our user accounts and starting with provisioning those accounts moving up to looking at the decisions we use to determine who gets access to water of course we'll talk about principles least privilege and need to know access but also some minor access control models that we actually used to implement those concepts so that's our identity and access management chapter 5 then security assessment in testing so here we're going to focus on vulnerability assessments and penetration tests and we'll look at some of the strategies some of the ideas behind that chapter 7 security operations this is a chapter that covers ideas you can honestly that didn't fit other places that are part of the day to day security operations within organizations here we talk about redundancy of. Weatherstrip backups clustering rate we talk about some of the other ideas about change management configuration management so that's in chapter 7 and then last but not least software development security another important chapter we'll talk about the software development life cycle we'll talk about some common exploits in software per particularly looking at cemex what's with web applications and some mitigating strategies and then we'll talk about database the old joke watch rob the bank that's where the money was well wired databases a target that's where the data is so this is going to be the order in which we're going to cover these modules if I were to really focus on topics here off the syllabus or just in general for the exam by far chapter one security and risk management just getting some of these ideas that will talk about over and over again cryptography even though it no longer has its own chapter still very very testable telecommunications or communications or network security chapter 4. And then chapter 8 software development securities so big chapter 1 portions of chapter 34 in chapter 8 that doesn't mean there aren't tests questions of course on the other chapters but those are really. Thank you for listening
