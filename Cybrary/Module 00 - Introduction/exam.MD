This is a cyber a production the following lesson can be found at W. W. W..sighed worry.I. T. okay now we move along to the exam specifics just to tell you a little bit about what to expect for the exam it's 250 questions 25 of those questions are what we refer to as data questions meaning they don't count for you or against you and no you don't get to choose which of those are beta those are already pre selected she now you get 6:00 hours to complete the exam to be honest with you I don't even like to do something fun for 6:00 hours my my attention caps off right around 2:00 hours and I hear there's been many fine movies ask your lord of the rings was wonderful avatar was wonderful but if you can't tell me your story in about an hour and 15 minutes I got no use for each now the reason I say that is even for those that have much better attention spans than I harm this is a long tedious process I don't know of many people that enjoy a 6 hour change so one of the things I'm gonna talk about this week is how to stay focused how to keep your mind sharp how did not waste your time on parts of the question that don't matter and I really you know if you're one of those people that find yourself reading the same sentence again and again and again and not really digesting it I'll encourage you to do some tricks and some tips that will help you along the way so if you're like I M. as in all look to swirl I can help you with that. All right now you can mark questions for review as you're taking the exam so you go along and you find a question you want to think about little bit you could mark that question I will still encourage you to put in answer down you don't have an answer C.. She's just as good as anything go ahead market do not leave any questions blank because in the event that you run out of time you've it least giving yourself a shot at getting that question right by putting something so what I would recommend is read the question look at the answers give it your best gas market for review if you want to and come back to it now when you do more questions for review. Unless the skies opening you hear voice saying change your answer I would leave your answer **** this is not the type of exam that you want to go back and redo and redo rethink you're giving yourself a chance to overthink the question this is definitely an exam of best practice it's an exam of gut instinct it's not one of those exams were you have to go 45 layers under the surface so with something in you felt like the answer was B. unless you've had a clear indication that that's wrong leave it as is I generally speaking do not change my exercise marking answers I don't go back for review this is an exam out totally encourage you to move forward on not backwards K.. The judge Moore. 6 all right you will be provided with one white board of land the native does she get paper laminated sheet you'll get a sharpie and that is all you'll get actually you could play next to a race and if you want but they don't give you additional sheets are yet to make the most of it there are some things that I think lend themselves to what we refer to as of right now she and a brain dump is when you walk in and you start your exam in you just kinda unload those things that are on your mind maybe they might be things that you have difficulty remembering up maybe there might be little mnemonic tricks you want to jot down and again I'm gonna help you with those along the way. All right are you will have access to an on screen calculator some will give you the choice of an on screen or hard work out the real calculators are that'll be your choice but not all testing centers do that so don't count. Many of the testing centers also will give you headphones are noise cancelling headphones or at least little cheapo squishy earplugs again you can't always count on the testing center providing those resources so nothing else they won't let's take headphones in but maybe bring yourself up here there's little squishy your phone's up. Ear plugs and I'll tell you in the testing center there will be people other than CISSP exam takers you'll have various different folks taking all sorts of different exams and it can become very noisy as people are coming in and out I always seem to sit behind a side that person who's tapping their gas and you will have people shouting for joy when they faster weeping loudly just bring yourself in your box questions are weighted now remember not all questions are created equal as I mentioned in the previous material there certain topics like risk management business continuity cryptography telecom that you really really want to be solid knowledge as a matter of fact one of the phrases that's associated with I. S. C. I. S. C. square is that security transcends technology security transcends technology that's a very important idea in it it's absolutely true what that means is technology comes and goes but security in the principles behind security are there for ever and I think that's a very very wise statement and I think you'll find that's the heart and soul of the real work this exam so when you're looking at at you know which question is going to be waited more is it going to be what block sizes does 8 yes use or is it going to be what's the first step of risk management well the risk management questions going to be much higher weighted in my opinion that's certainly what I would think based on RISC square I I will give you kind of a standard disclaimer now I don't work with diocese where they do not consult me when they write their questions I have no inside knowledge but I can tell you as somebody who's been teaching for a long time and has a good strong success rate I will tell you that the information that I pass along to you I I think it's backed up with experience all right so this. CISSP mindset 1 of the things that I notice and sometimes I'll have people that are taking the exam and failed before they come in and set up camp in a lot of people you know gosh I've been doing this for 13 years 15 years 15 years whatever I've been doing this for a long time I'm just going to take this test you may have the technical knowledge to take the test but you may not have the right approach you may not have the right mindset in a lot of times I find really technical people get about a 650 on this exam sadly he needs 700 to pass in in my opinion the difference between that 650 for somebody that has knowledge in the passing score 700 is not having the right mindset the right mindset is so crucial all right so what makes that up. What's our coach well the first thing we have to understand our role in this exam I'm not a technician I'm not an architect I'm not an engineer I'm not a help desk person I am a risk advisors thank white the manager in this company you're there to collect information and advise senior management on the risks as you see that you are not a decision maker you're an adviser you're also not an actor in this situation meaning rarely is the correct answer going to be for you to act usually it's collect information for H. the second bullet point goes very closely there do not 6 problems do not fix problems. Well I don't know about you but I personally am heat 6 problems that's my job right I'm a problem solver but not on this exam I mean the lights. So think about something like this. You have an employee that has that management has decided to terminate. What is the first thing you should do. Okay so immediately we think will work in a research his account with the credentials but remember I'm a risk advisor when is the last time your risk advisor his log on to a server in revoked somebody's. Initials that shouldn't happen that's a violation of separation of duties right so what is the risk advisor do make sure the proper policies and procedures in place and inform the appropriate parties and I know that feels very weird we generally think of fixing problems but a big focus of this class is going to be think about change control think about the process thank long term shoes we're not running around putting bandaids on problems we're making sure the processes are in place to the problem still come up again you know when I say don't fix problems think about it this way. You've got windows 10 on all your systems you've just learned that there's a security vulnerability in windows 10 Microsoft has just put out a patch what do you do do you take that patch download it push it out to 200 computers in production. I hope not what do you do you download it you tested in the lab you go through the proper process so do not fix problems think about the process now don't get me wrong if they ask you you know they tell your employees been terminated and he's scheduled to be terminated at noon what should you do if the answers are only action items as in they would all require you to take action instead of consulting or informing then yeah revoke his credentials absolutely but I just want to stress in and for those of you that might work in the government this might be easy for you if there is an answer that involves bureaucracy and red tape. That's your answer go with. Sh who is responsible for security that's a tricky question who is ultimately responsible for security senior management senior management is ultimately responsible for the security of an organization and when you think about that think about that is why it right if I'm an organization. Where I am. I oversee a doctor's office for instance and one of my receptionist is party to a hit book compromise that receptionist is likely not the one that's going to be hit with a fine it's gonna be me as the owner of the proprietor or senior manager so when you think about who's ultimately responsible thank liability she's now who's responsible for the day to day security mechanisms everyone gets right but usually it's ultimately senior management their job is to create the policies procedures standards guidelines and then my job as an employee is to follow those so you know we want to kind of keep it clear that yes everybody has a role to play in security but the ultimate responsibility goes to senior management. All right next thing to consider how much security is enough. How much security is enough. In you know we've all been kind of trying to say here we think you can never have enough security sure you can. Absolutely you can have enough you can have too much security and if you don't agree with that thanks for a minute how many people watching this art class how many people do you think have a security guard that protects their front door at their home. And I can guarantee you the number of folks watching this class that you have a security guard patrolling their house. Are pretty small numbers. So why I mean it would be more secure if I did have a security guard I can't afford it you know why now if I had 10000 pounds of gold in my house I can afford it I can make that decision so ultimately the decision of how much security is enough the answers Justin. Should be very careful here because when I say just enough immediately people think we're going to cut corners and just do what we can barely get away with that's not the point I want to make the point I want to make here is the amount of security that's necessary stricken by cost benefit analysis what am I protecting what's it worth what's the potential value for loss and what's the cost to the counter measure every decision with security really ultimately comes down to risk decision right now you have my assets probability of loss impact of loss okay so we'll get back into that that idea of cost benefit analysis is huge here you can absolutely have too much security in the real answer how much security is enough really is just not one more point here if I. Under estimate the value of my assets right let's say I've got a laptop computer and if I would sell that laptop on Craigslist damn I get 200 Bucks for. So if I say well the value of my laptop is 200 Bucks then if I don't take into account the values the data on it if I don't take into account maybe the intellectual property maybe I've got health care information I could be subjected to a $10000 fine if that gets compromised so the value of an asset comes from a whole lot of different places it's not just the hardware having a true and complete understanding of the value of the asset is essential to making good cost benefit analysis we'll talk about that much worked out later sh so the next bullet point every decision we make starts with risk management values the asset probability of loss impact of loss. Every decision starts with one of my protecting what's it worth always the first step in risk management okay next bullet point security transcends technology security is so much bigger than the latest firewall the latest algorithm the latest mechanism the latest this impacts honestly good foundational security principles will always have to be in place before any of the technology will work and we'll look at instances where company maybe invested very heavily in firewalls or other technology in yet because their basic principles were not solid he still had security breaches all right this goes get safety is always the first choice on this exam we can never lose sight of what's important and protecting the life of our employees is always going to be first now. Part of this exam will cover physical security it's not a huge section but that's true as well but it but it's true that it's necessary as well so always when you're looking at the situation whether you know it comes up in disaster recovery we're back waiting building whatever it may be always think to save human life first even if you like the server better the person better than the person you're saving still choose the person that research. Good will. All right technical questions are for managers manager questions are managerial questions are for technicians what that means is don't get too deep here you know if your technician and you get a question in your thinking about hacking the registry you're going way too deep K. H. if your manager and your debating what the meaning of the word is is you're going way too deep in managerial stuff the idea is this is a one of the the phrases I think most accurate back this exam mile wide and an inch deep so we're not gonna get into modular mapped in order to discuss cryptography what we're going to go over the general concepts so if you find yourself one to deep technical people back up and see if there isn't a more general security answer founded in the principles of security team all right incorporate security into the design as opposed to adding it on later I would say that 1000000 times a friend of mine says security should be 8 Dan instead of straight down and I think there's a lot of truth that we should incorporate security every step of the process instead of doing the many things that we've done traditionally and just thought oh we better at secured you for a long time our functional baseline was doesn't work now our functional baseline is does it work security because it doesn't work securely then it doesn't work at all. All right last piece layered defense layer after layer after layer there's no one single mechanism that will protect you that will protect your data will protect your facility so what we do is we have 2 layers and these layers are gonna come through physical administrative and technical controls physical controls like door locks security guards administrative controls like policy and then technical controls like firewalls and encryption and all those things the important piece here is you know if you see a question about how would you protect blah blah blah always try to find an approach for an answer that slayer you know yeah you protect your data with encryption what what would be great also would be to lock your laptop and have policies in place for separation of duties so that somebody has no business on that system can't access hope that makes sense and if it doesn't by the first chapter you'll be you'll have it solid some say. All right so these things if I were you I cannot recommend this strongly enough this might be something like print out this might be something I jot down and I would remind myself of these issues before I take the exam for those of you that have been security realm for a long time sometimes stepping back in not fixing problems making sure you know senior management ultimately responsible for security. Watching out about how much you're using not the best you can get here is how much security is enough is driven by Chris you know just some of these ideas but I really want to stress you this is the heart and soul the second.
