This is a cyber a production the following lesson can be found at W. W. W..sighed worry.I. T. now as we begin with chapter one as I mentioned before this chapter is very very significant on the test really the 2 pieces that we have here risk management business continuity all decisions start with risk management in everything we do supports the continuity of the business so this is a very very big check to make sure you take lots of notes and pay attention all right so moving in we're gonna talk about some things really gonna set the ground work for a lot of the material that we're gonna cover in greater depth this we move forward so one of the first things that we'll talk about just the basics of security the security triad confidentiality integrity and availability and a lot of times you'll hear that refer to as the C. I. A. triad now there's actually a movement to call it the A. I. C. tri N. because they're afraid that we will confuse the CIA agency with the C. I. A. triad confidentiality integrity and availability I'm going to just trust that you guys can keep that separate in your mind and know that I will not talk about the Central Intelligence Agency in this class at all so I'm a creature of habit and learned it is the CIA tried that's what I'll continue to use but if you are using other course where if you're using some of the other books out there is perhaps you may hear them referred to it as the A. I. C. try. All right next we'll talk about that I trip late so we'll talk about identification authentication authorisation and auditing or accounting because all the thing is all about accountability but those are that that's basically the I access controls we're gonna get some of the security terms out there and we're to talk about the fight then we're going to cover the difference between governance and management a lot of times you'll hear those words interchangeably so it's very important to understand the role government plays in the organization the world management does then we'll move into talking about some legal issues we'll talk about compliance we'll talk about regulatory issues and then we'll look at professional ethics as well affect the I. S. C. square code of ethics is very much testable on this exam and by the time you take this exam you will have signed it so you might as well read it. Security policies standards procedures and guidelines once we've done our risk analysis and once we understood our. The value of what we're protecting the potential for loss the impact of that loss well at that point forward we didn't develop our policies and procedures so that we can operate within the acceptable. Level of risk so policies and procedures standards guidelines condense and then last but not least business continuity and disaster recovery big big big arm all the things that we do to make sure that our organization continues to move forward even in the event of a disaster whether that disaster is fire flood hurricanes tremendous loss of data security breach it really determines it really depends on the business whatever disasters or being able to move forward and continue operations even in the event of a disaster.
