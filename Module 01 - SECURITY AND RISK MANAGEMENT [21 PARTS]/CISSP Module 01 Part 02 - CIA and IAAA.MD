This is a cyber a production the following lesson can be found at W. W. W..sighed worry.I. T. now let's talk a little bit about the different types of requirements we've already said that a requirement should be smart now we're going to discuss what type of requirements that we have and one of the first elements that will look at is will look at core security requirements so what we need to address is we need to address how we're going to satisfy the CIA confidentiality integrity and availability that's our starting point and will address other areas of security as well but we start with the CIA so when we talk about confidentiality we may think about encryption we want to protect and keep secret secret so we will document how we're going to protect for instance personally identifiable information will list out specific algorithms or at least minimum key length minimum degrees of security will address overt attacks on confidentiality like cryptography and masking requirements to prevent data loss if you will not get a loss big data compromise so we talk about cryptography of course we're talking about encryption when we talk about masking when I enter in a password for instance and you see the asterisks instead of my password that's masking and that'll keep customer service reps for intruder for instance from seeing vital information like if they pull up your account they'll see nothing but asterisks and in the last 4 of your social security number for instance so that helps with overt attacks on cryptography covert attacks on cryptography might be steganography in steganography now now again this doesn't apply in all instances because just example with covert attacks steganography is a message inside another message or essentially in betting a message. H. in another or in some other format so we might want to document how we're gonna dress steganography in guaranteed that that's not an issue. We also want to think about when we're addressing confidentiality we also want to think about the 3 states in which data can be it can be at rest in process in in transit so when we talk about confidentiality we're gonna say okay got it wrist at rest should always be encrypted using no less than 80 S. 256 bit encryption. Thanks when dad is in process there's not a whole lot you can do to protect data in process because once static even the garrison cryptid on the hard drive it must be decrypted to get loaded into ram while a representatives working on that information it gets re encrypted for storage so you can't really do a lot to protect to encrypt data in process but you can follow good security requirements like a clean desk policy making sure that someone can't reach your screen you avoid shoulder surfing you know some of the basic security requirements don't leave your desk without locking your system. Data in transit we might say all that entrances must use a secure transition protocol like maybe SSL or TLS or I. P. set but must be protected in transit as well so some various examples of confidentiality requirements again how were we going to address the needs for privacy with our software. Now other secure requirements for the CIA triad the next as we look at integrity so how are we going to protect against modification of the system modification of the data making sure that the system performs as it should you know for instance when we talk about system integrity making sure internal and external odd values are consistent making sure that we protect against code injection code injection is a huge problem any kind that we allow user input we'll talk about code injection more later data integrity making sure that the data the file has been modified log files whatever in transit and for those types of modifications we look to see R. C.'s checksums we look to hashes or message digests Max for email messages we think about digital signatures so again this is how we address integrity and we might document certain integrity requirements like input validation should be used on all forms software should require anything that we publish should also provide a message digest so that when the user downloads they can be guaranteed that they the application they downloaded worked the file they downloaded hasn't been modified all of those are ways that we would address the system and data integrity now for availability requirements again C. I. A. don't forget availability is that a in the C. I. A. triad so how can we guarantee that this product is available to meet the customer's needs well service level agreements where we commit to a 99.999 percent uptime and if our product doesn't meet the customer's needs or doesn't meet that up time we generally compensate Satan in some meetings we can provide for. Our customers mean time between failure and mean time to repair metric so they can assess whether or not this mechanism will meet those needs our recovery point objectives meaning what is the customer's tolerance for data loss how current most the data B. what's the longest maximum tolerable downtime what's the longest the customer can be without the system so you can see down below some examples of availability requirements software mmhm where must meet the availability requirements per the SLA. Also what about support how many users should be able to access the software simultaneously house replication going to happen those would be issues that we dress with their availability requirements then we move on to think about authenticity and we talk about authenticity we want to validate and entities claim of identification so I'll identify do you by saying I'm Kelly hinder him the authentication place the piece says I must prove it so do Y. you know in some applications like usually web based applications we allow anonymous access anybody can access the web page because I want anybody to go to the website and purchase things for me. We can use basic authenticity where there's a password now with basic passwords transmitted in clear text that's a problem with digest it's a challenge response system so the password doesn't appear on the network in plain text we can use certificates we can use tokens they're all sorts of means smart cards biometrics they're all sorts of ways that we can authenticate but ultimately that should be specified as part of the requirements for our program we might also address multi factor authentication mutual authentication so when we talk about multi factor authentication you must provide a password into smart card for you must provide a thumb print in the password something like that more than one factor of authentication mutual authentication means the client authenticates to the server but then the server also has to authenticate to the client from authenticity we also look at authorization so making sure that the subject is authorized to access the object but that the subject only hence the rights based on least privilege and we talk about the principle of least privilege you're giving the absolute minimum rights and permissions to do your job so we want to make sure that principle of least privilege is always followed with authorization that needs to be addressed I love the crud operations love the crowd acronym create read update and delete but again making sure that based on job requirements and role within the organization you have just the bare minimum permissions and we talk about some access control models dak Machen our back our backs standing for role based access control one of the models I did not mention his route back which is rules based access control rules based access control would be used for instance like on fire walls or any sort of filter rule. The space systems follow if then logic if traffic is coming from the 10 network than allow it if traffic is coming from this network been denied so that idea based on rules would be another way that we control access and we require authorization before we authorize an entity a subject access an object. Okay system authorize authorization requirements might be access to highly sensitive information is limited to users with secret or top secret clearance on authenticated users will have read permission to public access page you know whatever those requirements are that meet your needs we have to address the address authorization. I count ability when we talk about accountability we want to be able to trace and action to a subject accountability and auditing go hand in hand and the success of auditing is really based on the identity of the subject and action is going to be mapped to the identity so if you go back you know 1015 years ago in many offices there would be 1 user account that everybody in the office would use in this was in smaller offices which you might have an office of 10 people and everybody had a single account and I won't even address the fact that that single account usually had a minute administrative privileges we won't even go down that trail but the problem with users multiple users sharing the same account is we get no accountability user 1 is an account shared by 15 people so who was it that actually win and modify the registry we don't have that knowledge because we don't have separate identities so why didn't these are really important part to allow authenticate I'm sorry to allow it counted bility and all that. So accountability requirements all failed log in attempts must be logged there must be sourced ID there must be time stamped lap that we could go back and add integrity requirements it say audit logs must be hashed to guarantee no modification so you can get into you know you can reference multiple requirements at the same point in time you know that accountability is only accountability if we can guarantee the integrity of the audit files are how long must we retain those audit logs how about overriding events what happens if the log file skipped off full again these are all requirements that we would address. All right authorisation so of course authorization is what you're authorized to do what activities you can perform and we've already talked about that a little bit those are the core security requirements from there we're gonna talk about general requirements thank you for listening for more free IT and cyber security training please visit W.
